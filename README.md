# ACF to Beaver Builder Testimonial module

This is a Beaver Builder module for pulling Advanced Custom Field repeater fields into a testimonial module.

## TODO

- Add checks for to see if Advanced Custom Fields Pro is active
- Add ACF and then delete `stubs.php`
- Remove all errors that are possible
  - this will hopefully ensure our plugin is good to go
- Add dropdown that will give options for the various sub fields of the repeater
